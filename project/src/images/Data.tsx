        <p>Here we have a bar chart of hesitancy rates across every state using estimates from the CDC and data from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s Household Pulse Survey (HPS).
          The state with the highest amount of strongly hesitant people is Montana with about 17% of people being strongly hesitant about the vaccine. Montana is the state
          with the highest hesitancy overall with around 47% of its population being hesitant about the vaccine.

        <p>Here we have a bar chart of COVID-19 deaths adjusted for population. To compare the differences between a state with a high total hesitancy rate and a state with a low total hesitancy rate, let's take a look at Arkansas and Oregon.
           32% of Oregon's population displayed hesitancy and have 210 deaths per 100,000.
           48% of Arkansas'population displayed hesitancy and have more than double the deaths Oregon has per 100,000 with 436 deaths. Oregon has more than a million
           more peope than Arkansas. 
        </p>  
        <p>
          While there may be a correlation between high vaccine hesitancy rates and high death rates in states. Further research needs to be done to confirm any causation
          and the potential reasonings behind such high rates of hesitancy.
